# The image files will be written to XDG_SCREENSHOTS_DIR if this is set
# or defined in user-dirs.dir, or to a fallback location XDG_PICTURES_DIR.

# Copy the file to ~/.config/sway/config.d/60-bindings-screenshot.conf (or to
# your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME location if set differently) to be able to overwrite
# existing shortcuts.
# Check 'man grimshot' for additional commands that you may find useful.
